Section 1: Introduction

We would like to analyze the distribution of covid vaccines across the US. 
Source of data and details about each of the columns can be found here: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/vaccinations#united-states-vaccination-data 

The data was collected by the OWID, or Our World In Data. They in turn rely on the data from the CDC, or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 

The data is organized as follows: The location and date columns tell where and when the observation was from. The other 12 columns give vaccine-specific information about that time and location.
